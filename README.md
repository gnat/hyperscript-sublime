# [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/) for Sublime Text

Provides syntax highlighting for the Hyperscript (`_hyperscript`) scripting language, both embedded in HTML and in a standalone file.

Hyperscript is the companion project of [HTMX](https://htmx.org).

### What is hyperscript?

* Event-oriented language.
* [Locality of Behaviour](https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour) in components instead of long javascript modules.
* Async transparency.
* No long event chains / christmas trees.
* Null safe.
* Saves a ton of code in components.

### What is the relationship between HTMX and Hyperscript?

* HTMX and Hyperscript are sibling projects.
* They are designed to work well together, HTMX for server-interactions and Hyperscript for pure front-end interactions, but neither requires the other.
